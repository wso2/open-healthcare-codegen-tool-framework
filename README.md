Open Healthcare Codegen Tool Framework
==========================

Open Healthcare codegen tool framework includes common utilities and interfaces to implement
tools for well known healthcare protocols(FHIR, HL7v2). This framework holds interpretations
of the spec data and easy to use utilities to access spec data when writing tools.
These tools can be written to generate useful artifacts such as OAS definitions, Data mapping 
libraries etc.
